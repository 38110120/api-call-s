# api-call-s

In this sample project i worked on the Api call's using the asynchoronous Methods, worked on
 # fs.readFile it is used to do for reading a textfile data,
# fs.readFile it is used to do for reading a textfile data
# fs.rename it is used for renameing a file of a existing one and fs.unlink and fs.appendFile
# fs.unlink it is used for deleting a text file
# fs.appendFile through this we can attach some data(text) to a existing file and also if the file is not present it can also create a file and keep the data in it.


And also i worked on the JSON data of the users connected to the Database using MongoDB and worked through the postman application and retrived the data from the Database too.
# used the asynchoronous(async, await) methods also in this ,
worked on the api call's like:
post: used to post a user's data
get: used to get the users data what we have posted to our DB
Patch: used to update the data through the Particular id of a user
Delete: used to delete the users data through the particular id of a user.

To run this project , we have to install the packages like express, nodemon, 
npm install express
npm install nodemon
